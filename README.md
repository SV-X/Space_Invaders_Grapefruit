# Space_Invaders_Grapefruit

As I am not an artist, I did not design any sprites myself. <br />
However, I did draw/recreate them myself via Krita. <br />

CHAT GPT: <br />
AI was used in coding some of the logic for this game, as when I initially started working on this project, I did not really know Python, let alone PyGame. <br />
